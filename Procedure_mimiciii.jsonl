She was admitted at [**Hospital6 **] from [**7-29**] to intravenous heroin until [**7-28**] when she voluntarily entered detoxification program and was started on methadone.  On [**7-29**], the patient began to experience sweats, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting and was noted to be mildly jaundiced.  She was sent to the [**Hospital6 **] Emergency Department from detoxification, afebrile and with a blood pressure of 100/60 and respiratory rate of 50s.  Her LFTs were markedly 1.5.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done which showed a normal liver, normal bile ducts and no ascites.  She was initially treated with Vitamin K, methadone and Phenergan, and on [**8-8**] was begun on lamivudine for hepatitis B treatment after her hepatitis panel came back positive for a hepatitis B surface antigen and negative hepatitis B surface antibody.  She was also found to have a positive hepatitis C antibody.  The patient's INR rose to 3.3 and she was transfused with two units of fresh frozen plasma during the course of her admission.  The patient's liver work-up at [**Hospital6 **] included [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody, iron studies and ceruloplasmin, all of which were negative.  The patient was also found to be hepatitis A, antibody negative.  On [**8-11**], the patient was discharged from [**Hospital6 **] to home with gastrointestinal follow-up.  Her INR at discharge was 3.55. The following day, the patient presented to the [**Hospital 11694**] Hospital Emergency Department.  Her LFTs on admission were as follows:  ALT 382, AST 376, alkaline phosphatase 165, T bilirubin 31, direct bilirubin 15.7.  Her ammonia was 105 and her INR was 5.  The patient had a head CT and toxicology screen, both of which were negative.  She was treated with Vitamin K and lactulose.  She also got Narcan without effect.  She was transferred back to [**Hospital6 **] on [**8-12**] with the following vital signs:  She was afebrile with a pulse of 86.  Respiratory rate of 20.  Blood pressure 147/81.

She was treated with increasing doses of lactulose without significant improvement in her mental status.  That in essence, was the [**Hospital 228**] medical course prior to her arrival at the [**Hospital6 2018**] on [**8-14**].  When she arrived here, her physical examination was as follows:  Her vitals were as follows:  Temperature 97.4. Pulse 82.  Respiratory rate 17.  Blood pressure 108/49, saturating 100% on room air.  In general, she appeared to be an ill-appearing woman, who appeared her stated age.  She was in no apparent distress and had marked jaundice.
